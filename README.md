# Lending Club Case Study
> The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

Used Exploratory Data Analysis to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions
1. The applicants are more likely to default in the early stage of loan tenure, hence after a significant tenure of on-time payments applicants are less likely to default
2. Increase in annual income decreases the chances of charged off, hence its significantly safe to lend loans to applicants having higher incomes
3. It evident that average interest rate is highest for small business purpose which indicates that small business purpose loans with high interest make it hard for applicants to repay
4. Applicants working for less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off, hence close to zero work experience applicants are a risk category
5. The applicants having higher income bracket for the same corresponding employment period are less likely to default
6. Likeliness of getting charged off is increases with grade moving from "A" towards "G"
